        <h2> What is Bouldering?</h2>
        <p>
            Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving </strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong> accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Bouldering?</h2>
        <p>Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, climbers of all ages can challenge themselves, celebrate each other's successes, and <em> build lasting friendships</em>.
